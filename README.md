# WOLMO Cookbook - Android

This Cookbook contains recipes that demonstrate how to solve common problems while using **WOLMO** in you daily development. Each recipe **must** be self-contained in a package and will be used as a reference to help you build up an application with **WOLMO**.

The Cookbook will also be used as a playground to test new stuff out. That does not mean it will be messy, the kitchen must be kept clean.

## Initial Setup
1. Setup the production keystore credentials: run `scripts/keystore.sh` from the project root directory or create app/keystore.gradle file manually:
```
ext.release_keystore=file('...')
ext.key_alias='...'
ext.key_password='...'
ext.store_password='...'
ext.mercadopago_public_key='"YOUR_PUBLIC_KEY"'
ext.mercadopago_public_key_sandbox='"YOUR_SANDBOX_PUBLIC_KEY"'

You can do it following [these instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup).
